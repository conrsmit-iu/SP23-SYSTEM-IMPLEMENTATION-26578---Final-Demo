  <h2>Pick It Ticket? Who's that?</h2>
  <h5>Your one-stop shop for all your ticket needs</h5>
  <p>
    Have you ever been to a theater and been discomforted by the lack of
    suitable seating for you or your party? A party of six that couldn't find
    six seats next to each other? A disabled individual who needed a seat on the
    edge but simply couldn't find it? Maybe you really wanted a front row seat
    for this event? Well you won't have to face such issues anymore! We here at
    Pick It Ticket work with your theater to provide accomodation for any and
    all seating needs!

  <h2>How does Pick It Ticket work?</h2>
  <h5>A simple solution for a not so simple problem</h5>
  <p>
    When a theater is working with Pick It Ticket, we create a map of any room
    in the theater and assign each seat a number. When you or your friends buy a
    ticket, instead of the usual free-for-all that occurs in the theater, you
    instead are buying the specific seat you chose. When someone's reserved a
    given seat already, we let both you and the theater know so you can instead
    look for another spot that works for you! We also offer options to help you
    find the best arrangements for your needs!
